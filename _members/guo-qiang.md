**Brief:**<br>
I'm a climate change scientist with interests in climate change impact assessment, urban heat islands, regional climate modeling, global water resources, and machine learning.<br>
My research began with statistical and dynamical downscaling of climate model outputs and examining the hydrological impacts of climate change. Currently, I focus on accurately forecasting heat stress under global warming and developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for society. To achieve these goals, I utilize a variety of tools, including multi-source datasets (e.g., station data, remote sensing, climate model simulations, mortality/morbidity observations), physical-based numerical modeling (e.g., WRF), and machine learning techniques.
