# Opening

C2S Group is part of the [Department of Engineering Mechanics and Energy](https://www.eme.tsukuba.ac.jp/), within the [Institute of Systems and Information Engineering](https://www.sie.tsukuba.ac.jp/eng/) at the [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/).  

Our mission is to advance understanding of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and to develop practical solutions for addressing these complex and evolving challenges.
We generate new insights into how climate change is reshaping both natural and human systems, with a focus on areas such as urban sustainability, extreme weather events, economic development, and water and food security. To achieve this, we leverage cutting-edge tools, including physically based models (e.g., GCMs, RCMs, LSMs), multi-source datasets (e.g., climate observations, remote sensing), and machine learning techniques.  

We are actively seeking motivated Master’s and Ph.D. students with interests in hydrology, regional and urban climate, smart cities, climate change impacts, and machine learning to join our research team. If you’re interested, please feel free to contact the group PI, Dr. Guo (qiangguo@kz.tsukuba.ac.jp).
